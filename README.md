# Chat Server

Work in Progress

## Overview

The "Chat Server" is a personal study project focused at crafting a viable prototype of a chat API. It is purposefully designed to simulate the necessary schemas for a chat module, like users, chat rooms, and messages. Built with the intention of seamless integration with **any frontend user interface**, it offers a smooth and intuitive consumption experience across different platforms. This chat API serves not only as a **solid foundation** for future chat-based projects, but also as an invaluable resource for **enhancing one's understanding of backend development**.
